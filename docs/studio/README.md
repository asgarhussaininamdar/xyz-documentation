# Introduction

**[HERE Studio](https://studio.here.com)** is an interactive, visual, web-based application for accessing Data Hub data and creating maps within minutes - without any code.

> #### Note
> This version of HERE Studio (studio.here.com) and its documentation is deprecated. The documentation for its 
> successor, Studio 2.0 (platform.here.com/studio), can be found [here](https://developer.here.com/documentation/platform_studio/user_guide/index.html). 


The _previous_ Open Documentation for HERE XYZ is hosted on [here.xyz](https://here.xyz).

The documentation is written by developers for developers, and we hope it's helpful for you. It is structured slightly differently than the official [HERE XYZ Developer Documentation](https://developer.here.com/documentation/xyz) because we want highlight concepts we think are really important and also put it into context of a broader interoperability with other tooling. As such we will include over time content from the broarder community.
